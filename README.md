## Malware Bazaar Getter and accompanying scripts

Gets malware from malware bazaar, then moves it around, and puts it into ADX one at a time 

Nobody knows why.

getter.py - get malware from Malware Bazaar, configurable.
Create_job.py - puts the contents of a directory into ADX, submitting them one at a time
Checker-pull.sh - sets it up and runs Create_job, assumes you have an S3 bucket and data set set up already, and have already selected what you want to put into ADX. Also clamav scans it just for a point of reference. I mean, it's not like you'd do this every day.

There's no linkage from getter to Create_job as there was no need.

You will also need an AWS account and, of course, credentials. Uses Boto3 in the usual way.
